Privacy Policy — Last Stand Hold’em

Effective date: October 6, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Last Stand Hold’em (“the App”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our iOS application.

If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.

Who we are

Developer: Lance Stupfel
App Platform: iOS
Hosting for this policy: GitHub

What we collect

We aim to collect only what we need to run the game, improve stability, and (if enabled) show ads and leaderboards.

1) Data you provide

Support messages: If you email us or open an issue on GitHub, we receive the content you send and your contact details.

2) Data the App processes

Gameplay & progress: Coins/chips, wins/losses, achievements, level progress, timers/lives state.

Identifiers:

Game Center (if you sign in): Apple Game Center ID, display name for leaderboards/achievements.

Push notifications (if you opt in): A device token to deliver notifications.

Purchases (if used): Non-sensitive purchase metadata from StoreKit to grant content (no full card data is ever handled by us).

Crash & performance data: Crash logs, device model, iOS version, and basic diagnostics.

Ads/analytics (if used): Ad impressions, approximate location inferred by IP, device identifiers for ad frequency capping and analytics.

We do not collect your precise GPS location, contacts, photos, microphone, or camera data.

How we use data

Operate core features (save/restore progress, lives reset timers).

Show leaderboards/achievements via Apple Game Center (optional).

Deliver push notifications you opt into (e.g., lives refilled, rewards).

Improve stability and performance (crash reports, diagnostics).

(If enabled) Provide ads, prevent fraud, and measure ad performance.

Legal bases (EEA/UK users)

Performance of a contract (provide the App/features).

Legitimate interests (security, fraud prevention, crash reporting).

Consent (personalized ads, push notifications, Game Center sign-in).

Sharing

We don’t sell your personal data. We share limited data with service providers to operate the App:

Apple: Game Center, StoreKit, push notifications (APNs).

Google AdMob (if ads enabled): ad serving, frequency capping, fraud prevention.

Firebase (if used): analytics, crash reporting, remote config, messaging.

Error reporting (if used): crash/diagnostics vendor.

Each provider processes data per its own privacy policy. We only provide the minimum necessary for their services.

Data retention

Gameplay/progress: kept while you use the App; deleted or anonymized after account deletion request or prolonged inactivity.

Crash logs/analytics: typically 90–25 months depending on the provider’s defaults or our configuration.

Legal/compliance records: retained as required by law.

Children’s privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13. 
Your choices & rights

Do Not Track / ATT: iOS will ask if you allow tracking for personalized ads. You can change this later in Settings → Privacy & Security.

Game Center: You can sign out in Settings → Game Center.

Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

International transfers

Data may be processed outside your country. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs for EEA/UK transfers).

Changes to this policy

We may update this policy from time to time.
